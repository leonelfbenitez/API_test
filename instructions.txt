NOTE: This is an optional assignment which will give you 5 additional points to your final grade.

Instructions: You will need to create a video tutorial (around 8 minutes) about creating an API REST Service (something similar to what I did in the previous recordings). The API must include the following features: Create records, list records, delete records, and edit records.

Requirements:

You must create your own database with different structure and data.
You only need to explain your database schema, source code, and show a demo of your API working.
What and how to submit:

You can share me a link to Youtube, DropBox, Google Drive (somewhere where I can download your video)
If the size is not too big, you can submit your video directly to iCollege.
